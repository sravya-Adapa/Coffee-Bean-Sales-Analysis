# Coffee-Bean-Sales-Analysis
For the Coffee Bean Sales Analysis, the dataset consists of three worksheets: Orders, Customer, and Products, each containing relevant details such as order information, customer information, and product specifics. The analysis aimed to calculate total sales over a specified period, sales by country, and identify the top 5 customers. Data preprocessing involved using VLOOKUP to retrieve customer details like name, email, and country, and INDEX and MATCH functions to pull product-related information, including coffee type, roast type, size, and unit price. The sales value for each order was calculated by multiplying the quantity and unit price. Additionally, IF functions were used to expand coffee type abbreviations, and both date and sales formats were adjusted for consistency. A Pivot Table was created to summarize total sales, with months and years as rows and coffee type as columns, with the sum of sales as the value. To visualize the sales trends, a line chart was generated, with appropriate titles for the X and Y axes, as well as chart labels. A timeline for sales was added along with three slicers for coffee roast type, loyalty card status, and size to enable further analysis and filtering.
